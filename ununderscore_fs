\ Description

\ This file renames all original words of SuperForth, replacing
\ underscores with hyphens. The point the new words added by
\ Sfera use hyphens, including all standard words. So this
\ module makes all names homogeneous.
\
\ This tool runs automatically and then forgets itself.
\
\ At the moment this tool is experimental. The rest of the Sfera
\ library uses the original words of SuperForth.
