== 0.0.0

Initial development, from 2015-12-31 to 2016-01-14.
Started from a simple boot file.

== 0.1.0+20160115

First usable version.

The main words are defined in the <boot_fs> file. Optional words are
in Forth or binary files.

=== Main features

- `code`, `end-code`, `next,` and other basic words to facilitate
  creating machine code definitions.
- Set of standard address arithmetic words.
- Set of header addresses words.
- New operators and stack words.
- Nestable `include`, `included`; non-nestable versions `include-code`
  and `included-code` for assembled binary files.
- Nestable `require`, `required`; non-nestable versions `require-code`
  and `required-code` for assembled binary files.
- Tool modules: `dump`, `wdump`, `adump`, `decode` (some fixes
  pending).
- Floating point module updated with standard names, and some comus
  addons.
- New parsing and compiling words, like `postpone`.
- Basic initial support for standard strings.
- Numeric prefixes: `c#`, `h#`, `d#`, `b#`.
- Fixed two name clashes: `char` is renamed to `chr@` and `unused`
  is renamed to `spared`. Standard `char` and `unused` are provided.
- New string operators which work with ordinary counted strings
  (the SuperForth string operators work only with its own format,
  which include the maximum length).
- Conditional compilation.
- Standard `endcase`.
- Words to facilitate reading the keyboard.
- Words to facilitate managing the windows: `set-window`, `window`,
  `set-main-window`...
- `boot` reboots the Forth system.
- Standard `value` (single-cell values only).
- System information words: `screen-size`, `get-mode`, `sys-vars`,
  `current-job-id`.

== 0.1.1+20160115

- Fix: Removed a missing old file loaded from <boot_fs>.
- Change: Updated some file headers.

== 0.2.0+20160126

- New: more system information words: `machine` , `processor`,
  `display-type`.
- New: words to allocate memory from the OS common heap: `aallocate`,
  `afree`, `aunused`.
- Change: `screen-size` is renamed to `display-size`.
- New: standard deferred words: `defer`, `defer!`, `defer@`, `defers`,
  `action-of`, `is`.
- Removed `win-base-len`, which still is a draft.

== 0.3.0+20160213

Main changes:

- Improvement: included files don't need `end-of-file` anymore.
- New: 8 configurable paths for source files.
- New: `s"` (finished), `slit`, `sliteral`, `s+`.
- New: circular string buffer.

Other changes:

- Improvement: one loader for every binary module, so all modules can
  be loaded with the standard words, no matter if they are coded in
  Forth or assembly.
- New: `al@`, a variant of `a2@` which puts the low part on top of
  stack.
- Fix: the limit of nested sources is checked.
- Change: files of `aallocate` and `aunused` are renamed, according to
  the convention representing Forth word names by their components,
  the way they are pronounced.
- New: `dp`, `align`, `move`.
- Change: `uppercase` expects an address and a length.
- Change: Moved `dump-address`, `allocate`, `save-mem` and `?\` to
  their own files.
- New: `?os-error`.
- Fix: `set-default-channel`.
- New: __bench_fs__.
- Fix: renaming of `unused` to `spared`.
- New: `ununderscore`, a tool for renaming the original words of
  SuperForth.
 
== 0.3.1+20170909

- Fix source corruption in the `tuck` module.
